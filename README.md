## Project_1_group7
In this project, our group conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on online shopping data to gain insights into customer behavior and how people were spending money online. We cleaned the data, utilized various data visualizations to answer our specific questions, and performed a regression analysis to explore relationships within the dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about online shopping transactions, including customer demographics, purchase history, average price, delivery charges, and location. The dataset was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksondivakarr/online-shopping-dataset/data.

# Data Cleaning
Before proceeding with the analysis, we conducted thorough data cleaning to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the dataset. This involved handling missing values, removing coulmns that would not add value to the analysis, and standardizing data formats, such as datatimes.

# Data Visualizations
We employed a variety of data visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and pie plots, to explore different aspects of the online shopping data. These visualizations helped us identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset.

# Regression Analysis
To further analyze the relationships between variables in the dataset, we performed a regression analysis. This allowed us to identify relationships based on various factors such as demographics, delivery charges, and location.

# Results
Data Cleaning: The data cleaning process resulted in a clean and more usable dataset for analysis.
Data Visualizations: The visualizations provided valuable insights into customer spending, spending based on gender, and spending in relation to delivery charges.
Regression Analysis: The regression analysis revealed no significant relationships between average product prices and delivery charges. There was also no significant relationship between gender and location when in reguards to online spending.  

# Conclusion
In conclusion, our EDA project on online shopping data allowed us to see limitations in our data 

In conducting the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for this project, it was observed that no significant relationships or patterns were identified in the dataset. The analysis was hindered by various data issues, including inconsistencies, missing values and columns with unknown origins, which impacted the reliability of the results. In future projects more initial data review should take place to ensure that the data source is reliable and could be better used for analysis. Even though our EDA didnt yield any significant insights its a good place to start for further analysis.
